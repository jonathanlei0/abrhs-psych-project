          <p>The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure in the body’s limbic system associated with emotions,
            desires,
            and memories; rather than dealing with psychodynamic theories, the hippocampus is the brain’s storage center
            for one’s conscious, explicit memories. However, how would external substances impact the function of the
            hippocampus? Drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine have been heavily documented for their deleterious
            effects on the human body, but certain drugs — including cannabis or marjuana — have not been deemed as
            particularly harmful. With cannabis legalization becoming more widespread in the United States as a pain
            reliever, scientists have explored the structure of compounds inside marijuana that provide relief and
            potentially other undesirable effects on the hippocampus.[2]</p>

          <p>Marijuana contains compounds known as 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) and that provide a pleasurable
            sensation.[3]
            THC is no new discovery; scientists extracted it from plants as early as the 1940s.[4] Regardless, because
            of
            increased
            marijuana usage amongst the general public, knowledge of the compound’s effects on the hippocampus is only
            progressing.
            THC is incredibly potent because our body possesses its own endocannabinoid system (ECS); the ECS
            comprises
            a
            vast
            network of chemical signals and cellular receptors that are densely packed throughout our brains and
            bodies.
            The
            cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1) in the central nervous system (CNS) — meaning the brain and spinal cord —
            outnumber many
            of the other receptor types on the brain. They are the “traffic cops” that monitor the levels and activity
            of
            many other
            neurotransmitters. To stimulate these receptors, our bodies produce lipid neurotransmitters called
            endocannabinoids,
            which have a structural similarity to molecules in the cannabis plant. When endocannabinoids bond with CB1
            receptors,
            the brain receives a signal to release dopamine, the “pleasure chemical.” The first endocannabinoid that
            was
            discovered
            was named anandamide after the Sanskrit word ananda for bliss. Simply put, we all possess tiny
            cannabis-like
            molecules
            swimming around in our brains.</p>

        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8">
          <p>The cannabis plant, which humans have been using for about 5,000 years, hijacks this cellular machinery.
            Anandamide
            (C21H30O2) and tetrahydrocannabinol (C22H37O2) are lipids with very similar chemical structures; the two are
            very
            similar in molar mass and contain nonpolar regions (C-H) and polar regions (C-O) which can both interact
            with
            the CB1
            receptor’s active site to trigger the release of dopamine. As such, THC serves as a competitive inhibitor,
            or
            a compound
            that can bind to the CB1 receptors and produce a pleasurable feeling via external intake of cannabis,
            “crowding out”
            natural endocannabinoids from binding to the CB1 receptors. What is more, THC signals the brain to release a
            significantly larger amount of dopamine than anandamide does, creating a significantly more pleasing
            experience for the
            cannabis user. As a result, the human brain signals for the body to produce fewer natural endocannabinoids
            for
            efficiency — the cannabis is providing them now and in greater quantities. However, once the THC effects
            wane,
            the human
            body now lacks an appropriate amount of endocannabinoids, occasionally leading to a cannabis withdrawal
            syndrome (CWS).</p>

          <h3>Effects of THC on the Hippocampus</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>Now that we know that THC can provide pleasure to our body at a higher level than anandamide, let’s ask
            this:
            how can
            THC affect other parts of the brain such as the hippocampus? Because CB1 receptors can be found all
            throughout
            the
            central nervous system, they are also present in the hippocampus. As such, the excessive dopamine released
            when THC
            bonds to these receptors can actually become more harmful than helpful; studies have shown that pre-teen,
            adolescent,
            and young adult marijuana usage are more likely to perform poorly in school and face conflict with the law.
            A
            current
            theory is that the overload of dopamine can lead to a loss of focus, ability to solve complex problems, and
            retain
            memories. The latter of the three is crucial when thinking about the hippocampus, our memory receptacle. In
            fact, more
            research has shown that chronic marijuana users have significantly smaller hippocampuses than people who do
            not use
            marijuana and exacerbate the age-related loss of hippocampal neurons, leading to cases of short term memory
            loss.[8][2]
            Certain conditions such as depression, which can make it difficult to pay attention as well, make an
            individual more
            prone to memory loss. Considering that nearly 25% of adults with depression use marijuana, damage to the
            hippocampus and
            consequent memory loss is easily exacerbated. Interestingly, chronic abstinence in marijuana users will
            return
            hippocampus size to normal, suggesting that marijuana’s effects, albeit harmful, may not be as permanent as
            opponents of
            the drug may claim.

            Thus, although THC’s addictive properties have empirically damaged the hippocampus and led to biological,
            psychological,
            and social alterations in cannabis users, these effects do not seem to be permanent. Cannabis’ widespread
            usage has only
            manifested in the last two decades, and states are only becoming more lenient with the drug; it remains to
            be
            seen what
            further effects THC has on hippocampus activity over a lifelong period.
