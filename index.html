          Effects of THC on the Hippocampus</h1>
        <p class="py-3">THC acts as the main psychoactive component of marijuana. We amalgamated the latest research on
          the THC's effects on the hippocampus, revealing critical insights essential for understanding marijuana and
          its impact on the brain’s ability to form and retain memories.</p>

              particularly harmful. With cannabis legalization becoming more widespread in the United States as a pain
              reliever, scientists have explored how the compounds inside marijuana may impact the

              sensation.<a href="#citeNida"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
              THC is no new discovery; scientists extracted it from plants as early as the 1940s.<a
                href="#citeForbes"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Regardless, because
              of
              increased
              marijuana usage amongst the general public, scientists are still frequently making new discoveries of the
              compound’s effects on the hippocampus.
              <br><br>
              THC is incredibly potent because our body possesses its own endocannabinoid system (ECS); the ECS
              comprises a vast network of chemical signals and cellular receptors that are densely packed throughout our
              brains and bodies. The cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1) in the central nervous system (CNS) — meaning the
              brain and spinal cord — outnumber many of the other receptor types on the brain. They are the "traffic
              cops" that monitor the levels and activity of many other
              neurotransmitters. To stimulate these receptors, our bodies produce lipid neurotransmitters called
              endocannabinoids,
              which are structurally similar to molecules in the cannabis plant. When endocannabinoids bond with CB1
              receptors, the brain receives a signal to release dopamine, the "pleasure chemical." (The first
              endocannabinoid that
              was
              discovered
              was named anandamide after the Sanskrit word ananda for bliss). Simply put, we all possess tiny
              cannabis-like
              molecules
              swimming around in our brains.

            <p>
              With THC binding to the brain’s cannabinoid receptors, it competitively inhibits the binding of
              anandamide
              to the CB1 receptor. While triggering the release of dopamine, it
              "crowds out" natural endocannabinoids from binding to the CB1 receptors.
              <br><br>
              First and foremost, THC's binding to CB1 receptors disrupts the flow of information and feedback between
              neurons.
              <br><br>
              Further, THC
              signals the brain to release a significantly larger amount of dopamine than anandamide does, creating a
              significantly more pleasing experience for the cannabis user. As a result, the human brain signals the
              body to produce fewer natural endocannabinoids on its own, resulting in the cannabis becoming more and
              more responsible for the brain's pleasure and thus resulting in users consuming them in greater
              quantities.
              <br><br>When THC consumption is reduced, effects wane, resulting in the human body lacking an
              appropriate amount of endocannabinoids. This effect — which only occasionally occurs — is called

            <p>Whereas THC can bind to CB1 receptors to force the release of dopamine to our body at a higher level than
              the naturally-occuring anandamide chemical, how can THC affect other parts of the brain such as the
              hippocampus?
              <br><br>Because CB1 receptors
              can be found all
              throughout
              the
              central nervous system, they are also present in the hippocampus. Mice without CB1 receptors have better
              memory, suggesting that CB1 receptors help forget memories. <a href="#citeCWS"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
              <br><br>A prevailing theory is that the overload of dopamine lead to THC binding to
              CB1 receptors, triggering the extinction of old memories. As such, extended use of THC can lead to worse
              memory. Further, the usage of THC can make the brain fundamentally alter the way memories are formed. In a
              study involving rats, researchers found that in childhood and adolescence, rats given THC develop weakened
              pathways for memory formation that affect them into adulthood.

              In fact, more research has shown that chronic marijuana users have
              significantly smaller hippocampuses than people who
              do not use marijuana <a href="#citeNida"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. In addition, marijuana exacerbates the
              age-related loss of hippocampal neurons,
              leading to cases of short term memory loss. <a href="#citeCWS"><sup>[11]</sup></a> <br><br>
              Certain conditions such as depression, which can make it difficult to pay attention well, can make an
              individual even more prone to memory loss. Considering that nearly 25% of adults with depression use
              marijuana, damage to the hippocampus and consequent memory loss is easily exacerbated <a
                href="#citeGorfinkel"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. In a study involving teenage rats, brain damage persisted into
              adulthood. On the other hand, for adults, interestingly chronic abstinence in marijuana users will return
              hippocampus size to normal, suggesting that marijuana’s effects, albeit harmful, may not be as permanent

              Thus, although empirical evidence has shown that THC’s addictive properties can damage the hippocampus
              and lead to biological, psychological, and social alterations in cannabis users, these effects do not seem
              to be permanent. Still, THC significantly inhibits short-term memory formation, which can prove
              detrimental, especially in demanding situations.
              <br><br>Cannabis’ widespread usage has only manifested in the last two decades, and states
              are only becoming more lenient with the drug. There may be many other unknown effects of the drug,
              including long-term ones, so it's important that we continue to devote resources and attention to further
              research — with studies showing that pre-teen, adolescent, and young adult marijuana usage are more likely
              to
              perform poorly in school and face conflict with the law, it's important to understand how it impacts the

          Cannabis Withdrawal Syndrome (CWS) occurs once a regular marijuana user's CB1 receptors have been desensitized
          and downregulated. For most users, effects of desensitization and downregulation begin to reverse within the
          first two days of abstinence, and complete recovery happens within 4 weeks of abstinence. During this time,
          people experiencing CWS experience mood and behavioral symptoms.
